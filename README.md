# LoadEnv
This is a LoadEnv concurrently function in Golang. This is a part of my study in golang, this means that the `LoadEnv` still in progress. 

# How to use:

- Import LoadEnv in your workspace
- Call the function `LoadEnv.LoadEnv([argument])` (by default)
- Pass an argument to the function, this value must be the name of your local variable 
- Notice that the `LoadEnv` will try to find the `.env` file in the same directory. This means that the config file has to be in the same folder with the `.env` file
- The function will return a string value, so you'll have to convert into the value that you want

# Go get:
- Use the prompt `go get github.com/andrefsilveira1/LoadEnv` and import it in the file that you'll use the LoadEnv function
- Notice that it is recommended use the latest version of `LoadEnv`.
# Latest:
 V1.0.3


# Contribuition:

 As I said before, this is part of my study, so it will be quite nice if you help me in improve this code !
